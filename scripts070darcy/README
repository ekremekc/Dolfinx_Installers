I made a seperate directory for dolfinx dependencies up until petsc

Then I generate a virtual environment. Within that environment, I install the dependencies starting from petsc and then
- slepc
- python packages
 
 and so on. 
 
 It is important to note that installing cython at the beginning caused an issue during the installation of petsc4py and slepc4py
 
For some reason, I could not installed dolfinx_mpc but others work fine.
